# subleq-genetic

This is a genetic algorithm that attempts to print a specific phrase using bytecode on a one instruction set computer. I decided to use subleq (`subtract and branch if less than or equal to zero`) as the one instruction. The algorithm attempts to write a series of instructions on a virtual machine using this instruction set.

It works. For some definition of works.
